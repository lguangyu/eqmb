Emergency Question Mark Button (EQMB)
=====================================

For a certain professor that uses a lot of question marks when reviewing/commenting our manuscripts.
Some question marks are subject to lurk in the maintext because the said professor refuses to use the Word's 'comment' feature. Those lurking question marks are unprecedented gifts to any editor who it *may not* concern.

This project has an alt-name: the <b>EMERGENCY BUTTON for a certain PROFESSOR'S RESPONSE</b>, or the <b><font color="#8080ff">EBPR</font></b> button.
